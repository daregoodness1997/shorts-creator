0.0 - 4.96:  After reading tons of productivity books, I came across so many rules, like the two-year rule,
4.96 - 10.24:  the five-minute rule, the five-second rule. No, not that five-second rule. The problem is that
10.24 - 13.24:  that these rules are meant for companies or entrepreneurs,
13.24 - 15.72:  but I was able to adapt them to my studies
15.72 - 17.880000000000003:  during med school and drastically cut down
17.880000000000003 - 18.96:  in my procrastination.
18.96 - 20.8:  So I'm gonna share with you two different
20.8 - 23.64:  two minute rules for the next two minutes.
23.64 - 25.84:  The first two minute rule comes from getting things done
25.84 - 26.68:  by David Allen.
26.68 - 28.76:  He says, if it takes two minutes to do,
28.76 - 30.240000000000002:  get it done right now.
30.240000000000002 - 32.8:  For example, if I need to take out the trash today,
32.8 - 34.0:  it takes two minutes to do.
34.0 - 35.68:  So if I'm thinking about it now,
35.68 - 37.08:  might as well just do it now.
37.08 - 39.84:  Instead of writing it down on a to-do list
39.84 - 41.04:  or probably forgetting about it
41.04 - 42.76:  or having to come back to it later,
42.76 - 44.68:  which takes more than two minutes.
44.68 - 45.519999999999996:  That's how I see it.
45.519999999999996 - 46.599999999999994:  So here's a list of things
46.599999999999994 - 48.879999999999995:  that might take two minutes throughout the day,
48.879999999999995 - 51.519999999999996:  like organizing your desk or watering your plants
51.519999999999996 - 53.68:  or clipping those nasty nails.
53.68 - 55.08:  I just do it when I notice it,
55.08 - 56.56:  but these little things start to add up.
56.56 - 59.64:  So this rule biases my brain towards taking action
59.64 - 61.44:  and away from procrastination.
61.44 - 63.480000000000004:  The second two-minute rule comes from atomic habits
63.480000000000004 - 64.4:  by James Clear.
64.4 - 65.84:  He says, when you're trying to do something
65.84 - 68.32000000000001:  you don't really wanna do, simplify the task
68.32000000000001 - 69.76:  down to two minutes or less.
69.76 - 71.52000000000001:  So doing your entire reading assignment
71.52000000000001 - 73.4:  becomes just reading one paragraph
73.4 - 75.80000000000001:  or memorizing the entire periodic table
75.8 - 78.64:  becomes memorizing just 10 flashcards.
78.64 - 80.32:  Now, some of you might think,
80.32 - 82.72:  yeah, this is just a jedi mind trick.
82.72 - 84.2:  Like, why would I fall for it?
84.2 - 86.39999999999999:  How is this at all sustainable?
86.4 - 88.72:  And to that, he says, when you're starting out,
88.72 - 91.24000000000001:  limit yourself to only two minutes.
91.24000000000001 - 93.56:  So back in med school, I wanted to build a habit
93.56 - 96.60000000000001:  of studying for one hour every day before dinner.
96.60000000000001 - 99.36000000000001:  So I tried this trick, but I lived in myself
99.36 - 101.16:  to just two minutes.
101.16 - 104.44:  I'd sit down, open my laptop, study for two minutes,
104.44 - 106.64:  and then close my laptop and went to do something else.
106.64 - 108.88:  It seems unproductive at first, right?
108.88 - 109.72:  It seems stupid.
109.72 - 112.64:  but staying consistent with this two-minute routine
112.64 - 115.4:  day after day meant that I was becoming
115.4 - 117.72:  the type of person who studies daily.
117.72 - 120.76:  I was mastering the habit of just showing up
120.76 - 123.24:  because a habit needs to be established
123.24 - 125.28:  before it can be expanded upon.
125.28 - 127.2:  If I can't become a person who studies
127.2 - 128.84:  for just two minutes a day,
128.84 - 131.12:  I'd never be able to become the person
131.12 - 132.88:  that studies for an hour a day.
132.88 - 135.76:  You gotta start somewhere, but starting small is easier.
135.76 - 138.23999999999998:  There's a lot of other useful tips from books.
138.23999999999998 - 140.82:  I cover more here in this video on three books
140.82 - 141.78:  in three minutes.
141.78 - 142.62:  Check it out.
142.62 - 143.89999999999998:  And if you guys like these types of videos,
143.89999999999998 - 145.5:  let me know in the comments below.
145.5 - 146.34:  I'll see you there.
146.34 - 147.16:  Bye.
